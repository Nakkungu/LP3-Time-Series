# Regression Project (Store Sales -- Time Series Forecasting)

## Introduction/Objective

Welcome to the Regression Project focused on Time Series Forecasting for Corporation Favorita. This project aims to develop a robust forecasting model to predict store sales, empowering Favorita with data-driven insights for optimized inventory management and business performance.

## Project Structure

This project follows a systematic approach with the following structure:

```

```

- **data:** Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for EDA, trends analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
- **src:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and visualization.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the project dependencies.
- **README.md:** Documentation providing an overview, project structure, and usage instructions.

## Technical Content

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset using `main-1.ipynb`. Uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.

### 2. Trends of Sales Over Time
Analyze trends and seasonality of sales over time with `main-1.ipynb`. Identify patterns crucial for decision-making.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
Implement hyperparameter tuning for models using `main-1.ipynb`. Optimize model performance for accurate predictions.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the forecasting models in `main-1.ipynb`. Assess the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

## Conclusion/Recommendations

Summarize the insights gained from each step and provide recommendations for leveraging the predictive models to enhance Favorita's business strategies.

## Usage Instructions

1. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the notebooks in the specified order: EDA, Trends, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation.
3. Utilize the Python scripts in the `src` folder for data processing, feature engineering, model building, and visualization.
